## ICSP Codec
### Introduction
This is a implementation of video codec based on C/C++. <br />
I named this codec as ICSP codec because I implemented this when I was working in the ICSP lab(https://icsp.hanyang.ac.kr).
ICSP Codec has been implemented based on basic video compression theories like prediction, transform, entropy coding and so on.

if you have any kinds of feedback and question, please contact me.
