## ICSP Codec
### Introduction
This is a implementation of video codec based on C/C++. <br />
I named this codec as ICSP codec because I implemented this when I was working in the ICSP lab(https://icsp.hanyang.ac.kr).
ICSP Codec has been implemented based on basic video compression theories like prediction, transform, entropy coding and so on.
